# Development setup

[[toc]]

## Resource list
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Runtime for JavaScript
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) - Package manager for MacOS. Allows you to install software on your system using the command line easily. Linux distros come with this automatically, usually [`apt`](https://wiki.debian.org/Apt)

## Code editor
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

I use VSCode as my primary editor, so most of the tutorials or guides will be using VSCode only. You can easily use any other editor, as long as it get's the job done.
