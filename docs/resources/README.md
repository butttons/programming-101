### Frameworks
These are some of the most popular frameworks made by some brilliant people. You can use any of these to create a complex web app, totally depends on what suits you.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - Simple, easy to pick up, *recommended* for beginners. If you know basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can get started easily.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Very popular, high in demand, and amazing community support. The [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) format can be a bit jarring to understand. 
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Very popular too, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/#download-links). Has a fairly steep learning curve.
- [Ember](https://www.emberjs.com/) - Solid, highly productive framework. Comes with almost everything out of the box. Ember projects follow a strict convention, so it's easier to transition between different types of apps. Other frameworks provide a lot more freedom in this regard.

### Libraries
Some popular useful libraries. Each serve their own purpose, and there are alternatives to almost everything on this list.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for browser. Can be used with _node.js_ too.

### CSS Frameworks
These are some CSS Frameworks which you can use to quickly make your website look pretty. These come with their own look, which can be customized to a degree, depending on the framework. Using these allows you to keep the look of your website consistent. 
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - One of the most popular ones. Can be customized to suit your needs.
- [Material](https://material.io/) - Google's Material Design is fantastic, provides lots of themeing options.

### CSS Libraries
