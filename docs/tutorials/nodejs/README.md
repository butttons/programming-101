# Setup a new project

## Prerequisites
This assumes you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) on your system. Check by using the following command in a terminal.

```bash
node -v
```

If you see `command not found: node` then node.js is missing. Install it before proceeding.
Node.js comes with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), package manager for JavaScript. Another alternative is [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). To check you `npm` installed, run the following command in a terminal.
```bash
npm -v
```
